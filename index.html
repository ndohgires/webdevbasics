        <h1>interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level heading</p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element ( it stands for unordered list</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li> They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p> This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the rnew "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on thier own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things is this prrecise order</li>
            
        </ol>

<h4>Inline Elements</h4>

<p><em>Sometimes</em> , you need to draw attention to a particlar word or phase</p>

<p>Other times you need to <strong>stong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phase </p>

<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

<h4>Empty Elements</h4>
